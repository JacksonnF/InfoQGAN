## InfoQGAN
In this project we attempted to recreate the research done by Lee et al 2023 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.01363.pdf)

## Experiments Folder

The `experiments` folder contains Jupyter notebooks that document the development process of the InfoQGAN. These notebooks provide insights into design decisions and parameter tunings. Whereas the Python files were derived from these notebooks, ensuring a tested and validated implementation.
