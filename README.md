## InfoQGAN
In this project we recreated the research done by Lee et al 2023 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.01363.pdf)
Our main task was to demonstrate a working InfoQGAN. To do this we started by creating a GAN followed by developing a MINE network and later applying these to a quantum generator producing our final InfoQGAN. The working of these models is demonstrated by utilizing 3 datasets: a central square, and offset circle and two financial assets to promote the application of an InfoQGAN to MPT. 

## Experiments Folder

The `experiments` folder contains Jupyter notebooks that document the development process of the InfoQGAN. These notebooks provide insights into design decisions and parameter tunings. Whereas the Python files were derived from these notebooks, ensuring a tested and validated implementation.
